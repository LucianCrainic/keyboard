# Keyboards Layout and Configuration files
This repository contains the unified layout and source code files for both my work and personal keyboards. By using the same layout on both keyboards, I enhance productivity and improve muscle memory for efficient key combinations. Each layout is fully customized and compatible with QMK firmware, designed to support a consistent experience across different tasks.

This layout, used on both my work and personal keyboards, is designed for maximum efficiency with a foundation in layer switching and home row modifiers. It features:
- Symbol Layer: Provides quick access to all symbols, making typing and coding more fluid.
- Movement Layer: Combines mouse and arrow controls, click functionality, and function keys.
This setup minimizes hand movement and optimizes workflow, tailored to support both productivity and comfort across various tasks.

> [!CAUTION]
> I won't be providing a guide on building or loading these layouts, as they are highly customized to my specific preferences. I strongly recommend against directly copying someone else's layout
> instead, use this as inspiration to create a setup that works best for you. Tailor your layout to fit your unique workflow, comfort, and efficiency needs—it’s worth the effort!

If you're interested in creating your own keyboard layout, I recommend starting with the official [QMK Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/configurator_step_by_step). This step-by-step guide will help you configure and customize layouts tailored to your preferences, using QMK's powerful features to build a setup that works best for you.
